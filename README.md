# PyCLIBar

A progress bar for CLI scripts/programs

Is made to function like ttk's progress bar.

This project is still under construction

TODO: 
* ~~Implement estimated remaining time (but make it optional)~~
* ~~Implement shown pace (but make it optional)~~
* Make CLIBar.start() optional (there's no reason for it if remaining time/pace isn't wanted)

## How to use
See test.py for an example.
